This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your branch

Note that we really only have experience with using grub2 on Linux, so asking
us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Here's the template:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What upstream shim tag is this starting from:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://github.com/rhboot/shim/tree/0.8/]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What patches are being applied and why:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[None]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as close as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[It's done on something very close to the Fedora 25. http://mirrors.gd-linux.com/newstart-cd/x86_64/NSDL-V3.2.2rc5-x86_64.iso It can be built from the mock configure file at https://github.com/cxy-uestc/shim-review/tree/nsdl-3.0/nsdl-v3-x86_64.cfg plus the yum repo softwarecenter.repo. nsdl-v3-x86_64.cfg can be used to reproduce the entire build using shim-0.8-1.fc25.src.rpm from github. 
step1:create a user and its password in Fedora 25 or NSDL-V3.2.2rc5; 
step2:sudo dnf install mock with softwarecenter.repo under /etc/yum.repos.d/ 
step3:sudo mock -r nsdl-v3-x86_64 --rebuild shim-0.8-1.fc25.src.rpm --no-clean --no-cleanup-after
step4:shim binay package, build.log and root.log can be found at /DESKTOP/mock/nsdl-v3-X86_64/result/ 
note:
gcc, binutils and gnu-efi required package etc is OK if you follow the steps above]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?   This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[build.log]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add any additional information you think we may need to validate this shim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root.log]
